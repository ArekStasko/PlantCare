# PlantCare
Web App that will allows me to control ESP32 modules to irrigate my plants and check their soil moisture levels

This Web App have to connect to my ESP32 modules via API. What is more me as a user should be able to see moisture levels of my plants in a user interface,
i need to have an option of changing irrigating level via my web app for different plants. 

What is more i want to see the statistics of moisture in different levels, for example in minutes, hours, days and weeks.

How should it work with ESP32 ?
- ESP32 will call our Web App API with moisture parameters and it will receive current options like irrigating level etc.
- Our API will save data to database based on data from ESP32.

TODO: 
[ This list will be continuously modified due to changes in app ]
