# PlantCare
PlantCare is a system created for clear purpose, to manage your plants in comfortable and efficient way.
It allows me to quickly check soil moisture level of individual plant or read some notes about it.
I have a couple of plants in my room so i wanted to make generic module which can be use with any plant, here we have 
the ESP32 module with soil moisture sensor, it is responsible for registering soil moisture level and communicating with 
my backend ( here you can read more about it -> [PlantCare Module](https://github.com/ArekStasko/PlantCare_Module) ).
